# EchoRoom – Open Source Quest (OSQ) Guide

Welcome to **EchoRoom**, an official project under **Open Source Quest (OSQ)**.

This document explains how contributors should participate, what counts as a
valid contribution, and how work is evaluated during OSQ.

## 🎯 Objective of EchoRoom in OSQ

EchoRoom aims to:
- Teach collaborative, real-world product development
- Encourage experimentation and reflection
- Value documentation and design as much as code
- Promote meaningful contributions over quantity

---

## 🧑‍💻 Who Can Contribute?

Anyone participating in OSQ can contribute, including:
- Frontend developers
- Backend developers
- UI/UX designers
- Documentation writers
- Testers & QA contributors
- Beginners exploring open source

---

## 🔁 Core Workflow (Important)

Every contribution should respect EchoRoom’s learning loop:\
*Idea → Experiment → Outcome → Reflection*

Features, documentation, and UI should support this flow.

## 🛠️ Contribution Workflow

2. Get assigned by a maintainer
3. Fork the repository
4. Create a feature branch
5. Make focused changes
6. Open a Pull Request (PR)
7. Address review feedback

## ✅ What Counts as a Valid Contribution?

✔ Feature implementation  
✔ Bug fixes  
✔ UI/UX improvements  
✔ Documentation updates  
✔ Test cases  
✔ Design mockups  

❌ Trivial changes  
❌ Spam PRs  
❌ Plagiarized work

| Criteria | Description |
|-------|------------|
Quality | Clarity, correctness, maintainability |
Impact | Usefulness to the project |
Consistency | Regular engagement |
Communication | PR descriptions & discussions |

Quantity alone does **not** guarantee a high score.
